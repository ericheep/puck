A LED shield for an Arduino Uno that uses three daisy chained TLC5940s to control 16 RGB LEDS with PWM functionality. It can act mainly as a nightlight, but one in which you can program your own patterns (and give to your friends)! I used the wonderful tlc5940arduino library to control the chips. Code is free software, and the board files are hosted on my [website](http://www.ericheep.com/works/puck), and you can pop the zip right into OSH Park.
